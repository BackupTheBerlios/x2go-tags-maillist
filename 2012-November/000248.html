      Basic build system
      Adding a local directory option and setting the PAM install directory based on whether we're local or not
      Woot, we've got a PAM module
      Ignoring stuff
      Understanding the design
      Trying to get the values that we should know well
      Restructured so we can get all the items with prompts
      match the string by pam-remotelogin
      Let's call it!
      Enough that it's likely to authenticate.  Though, lots of TODOs at this point
      0.0.1
      Fixing the name to be what everyone else thinks it should be
      Only built the .so, it's a loadable module
      Matching the naming convention of the other modules
      0.0.2
      Changing the conv to a pointer of a pointer
      Fixing pointers to make PAM happy.  Uhg.  No segfault though
      Switch to pushing the creditials via stdin
      Setting the home directory to the user's directory

      Setting up our pipes, dropping privs, and fixing TODOs

      Set up the buffer and the socket and stuff like that as well.
      Drop privs if we have 'em
      Adding session stuff
      Adding a copyright header
      If we don't fork, then clean up
      Fixing up the ignore

      Using 'strstr' instead our own loop.
      Cleaning up the code to make it easier to read
      Handle URLs as the remote host value. Approved by Albert Astals Cid, jenkins.
      Adding a setcred function so callers are happy
      Saving the values once we get them
      Remove an unused define (cleanup)
      Protecting from a crazy thing that LightDM does
      Adding a setcred function so callers are happy. Approved by Albert Astals Cid, jenkins.
      Caching the password between authenticate and open_session
      Now that we have long running memory with a password in it, we need to lock it down
      Neat little trick that I found in PAM Kerberos where it uses the PAM handle's version of the value so that there doesn't have to be memory free'd in the returning function.  Cleans some things up and removes a bunch of extra allocation
      Set the permissions on the socket
      Making sure that there's no way that we can write over the end of the buffer even for very, very, very long home directory names.
      Locking the buffer 'cause it would have the password in it

      Use the pipe to signal when the subprocess has gotten to a point where it can opperate.
      Checking the return value of the mlock
      Locking memory if we expect the prompt to be returning a password
      Make sure to clear the environments
      Clear the groups when dropping privs
      Make sure to lock the password buffer
      Dropping the ignoring of the cert
      Make sure to change the working directory for the subprocesses to the guest user's home directory
      Making sure to kill as the user so that if there is PID wrap or something else we won't kill the wrong thing

      Adding a small auth check utility
      Make the auth use the auth check utility
      Make sure we have the full path to execute the auth check
      Adding an authenticate
      Add a set cred call like LightDM does it
